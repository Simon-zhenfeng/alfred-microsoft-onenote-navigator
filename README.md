Navigate OneNote Notebooks With Alfred
===============================

Use Alfred to browse through your notebook, sections and pages and then jump to them instantly.

How It Works
---------------
Every OneNote Notebook/Section/Section Group/Page has a URL that allows to jump to it, in a sec. I found a plist within the ~/Library/Containers folder that keeps track of the organization of the Notebooks so I was able to make my own URLs. One caveat though is that individual pages have UIDs that can't be predicted so it can only dive to the second deepest layer. That being said I use this all the time, one of my favorites!



Note
------
- 	I have a bunch of icons in the icons folder that I added but feel free to remove them or add to them
